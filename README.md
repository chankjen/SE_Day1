#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software Engineering Systematically applies software enginnering tools and methods to develop and maitain high quality software systems, through product designing, development,testing, deployments and maintenance. 
It's importance is it enables creation of software systems that power severa; aspects f modern life such as Healthcare, Communication, entertainment among others.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements are gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2. Design is creating a high value and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface.
3. Implementation- writing code and building software according to design specifications.
4. Testing is carrying out various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5. Deployment is releasing the software to users and customers.
6. Maintenance- providing continuous support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall methodology follows a sequential or linear approach where each phase, i.e, requirements, design, testing, deployment and maintenance must be completed before the other begins. e.g constructions and manufacturing projects. Once a construction starts, it is expensive to go back to make changes in design etc.
Agile methodology involves an iterative approach, flexible and collaborative and is best for projects where requirements are expected to evolve or are not fully known upfront. e.g software development and product design where feedback from users, stakeholders and market trends is continuously integrated to adapt to changing requirements.
Waterfall is suitable for projects with clear fixed requirements and less need for ongoing changes while agile is suitable for projects requiring adaptability  and frequent updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

A software developer writes code ad implements software solutions; a quality Assurance Engineer ensures Software quality by design an executes test plans; a Project Manager oversees planning, execution and delivery of Software Systems.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing , debugging and testing code e.g, visual studio, Intellij IDEA.
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g, Git, Subversion.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Changing Requirements during the development cycle, leading to project delays or scope creep.
2. Tight deadlines caused by pressure to deliver software products on schedules can lead to compromised quality.
3. techincal debt accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and ncrease maintenence costs.
To overcome these, we ned to have effective communications, agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessments of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

1. Unit testing is the testing of individual components or modules of software. It's crucial in catching issues early in development.
2. Integration testing is testing of interactions between different components or subsystems. It catches issues in the interactions between components.
3. System testing is testing the entire software as a whole. It ensures the software functions as a whole.
4. Acceptance testing is testing software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. It ensures softwaere meets user expectations and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It is the process of designing and crafting inputs for  AI models, specifically language models, to elicit desired responses or behaviours. It helps improve accuracy, usability, maximizes utility, reduces biases and optimizes performance through consistency and reliability.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague prompt- "Explain impacts of youth demonstrations"
Clear, specific, concise- "What are the socio-economic and historical impacts of the Youth led Demonstrations against the Kenyan Finance Bill 2024."
